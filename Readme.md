</div>

Quantum computing has emerged as a revolutionary field with the potential to revolutionize computation and solve complex problems that are beyond the |capabilities of classical computers. This project presents a comparative study of Quantum Naive Bayes and Classical Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithms applied to the NASA Nearest Earth Object Dataset. Quantum computing, implemented using the Qiskit library, is explored alongside classical machine learning for classification tasks.

## About

In our final year capstone project, we investigate the performance of Quantum Naive Bayes, implemented with help of Qiskit, and Classical Gaussian Naive Bayes on the NASA Nearest Earth Object Dataset. The project aims to understand the comparative strengths and weaknesses of quantum and classical machine learning approaches for classification tasks in the realm of space science.
